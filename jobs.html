       <h2>What is it like working at Redbeet?</h2>
       <p><b>In May 2018 we released our debut title Raft on Steam Early Access, and are now embarking upon an adventure to find new
    talents who wish to join our team. We work closely together in an open and friendly office environment where we openly
    share ideas and feedback.</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>Apart from a salary, you will also receive occupational pension and a great set of insurances. As we want our coworkers
happy and healthy we offer a wellness grant to help pay for activities such as gyms, sports etc. A while back we also
transitioned into a 7-hour work day to promote a good work/life balance, and we strive to keep overtime to a minimum,
which has worked out very well so far.
</p>
<br>
<p>The office currently offers table tennis, a Switch and some VR equipment for past time and break activities, but we are
open to expand this section if you have any ideas?</p>
<br>
<p>While Skövde might be a smaller town, it offers a lot of community and activities, especially for game developers. There
are a lot of game companies here which usually makes it easy to find people if you want to talk games, play board games
or grab something to drink. Game Developer Pub is a recurring evening of food, drinks and socializing hosted by Sweden
Game Arena, where the industry and local game students come together at a local restaurant, and during fall industry
professionals and beginners travel from all around the world to meet up at the Swedish Game Conference right here in
town.</p>
<br>
<p>With the train track going right through the middle of Skövde, you are only one hour from Gothenburg and two hours
    from
    Stockholm.</p>
